Jo is a Go-style JavaScript ES6 compiler and packager, based on Babel.

- Go-style *[convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)* means Jo is straight-forward and opinionated
- Modules are comprised of directories, not files
- Built-in linting will tell you about usage of undefined variables, etc
- Compilation and compatibility fills provided by well-tested Babel
- Separation of target code generation allows building both Nodejs code and web browser code, for optimal performance and linting
